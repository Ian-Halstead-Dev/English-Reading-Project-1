    <p>This message comes to you after Donovan and I made a critical mistake that almost caused one of our SPD (Speedy)
      robots to be destroyed. We sent him on a seemingly normal mission to get some selenium but he never returned. We
      waited hours for him to return, but never did. Eventually, we decided to go out and find him. We found one of the
      other robots in our lab, and ran out to where Speedy should have been. When we found him, he was acting very
      strange. He wouldn't listen to either Donovan or I, and acted like a drunk person might. Luckily, I realized we
      could make the first law take effect and make Speedy save one of us, but thats besides the point. Speedy could
      have very easily been destroyed, and it's all because of one careless mistake. When Donovan gave the robot the
      command, he gave the command no urgency. He gave it as a casual command, and Speedy put no emphasis on it. This
      may not seem like much of a problem, but when we look at the three rules of robotics, we realize why this was a
      mistake. The second law says a robot must obey and command given by a human, and the third law says a robot must
      preserve itself, as long as that doesn't violate the second rule. When Speedy was given the command, he didn't
      process it as important, so the third law took effect, and Speedy made sure not to get hurt. I'm writing this
      today to urge you to make sure every action you do towards a robot is done with care, so that the robots can
      fulfill their purpose and not slow down jobs.</p>
