          <h1>The Machine has Gone Away!</h1>
          <h3>Written by: Mrs. Weston | Date: 1998</h3>
          <p>When we first got Robbie, Mr. Weston promised me Gloria wouldn't get any connection to him. Here I am, 2
            years later, having seen my daughter 2 times all day, ready to get rid of Robbie. He has been raising my
            daughter! I've talked to George plenty of times about this, but he doesn't understand. He tells me all my
            fears are irrational. <span class="CTA">Read

          <h3>Written by: Gregory Powell | Date: 2015</h3>

          <p>This message comes to you after Donovan and I made a critical mistake that almost caused one of our SPD
            (Speedy) robots to be destroyed. We sent him on a seemingly normal mission to get some selenium but he never
            returned. <span class="CTA">Read

          <h1>A robot will never hurt a human in any way</h1>
          <h3>Written by: Mike Donovan | Date: 2016</h3>
          <p>It's the first rule of robotics. A robot can never hurt any human or by inaction allow a human to get hurt.
            We
            all knew this to be true, but I don't think anyone could imagine all the different ways robots would make
            sure
            they don't hurt us. <span class="CTA">Read

          <h1>Physical pain is not the only kind</h1>
          <h3>Written by: Susan Calvin | Date: 2021</h3>

          <p>When I think of pain I immediately think of physical hurting, and I imagine many others would as well. That
            is what most people think robots are forbidden to do by the first law, hurting humans physically. We have
            learned today that that is not entirely true. Robots still will never be able to hurt humans physically, but
            we were forgetting people can be hurt mentally or emotionally, and robots will never hurt a human mentally.

          <h1>The more we learn about robots, the less we understand</h1>
          <h3>Written by: Alfred Lanning | 2030</h3>

          <p> I know that title sounds bad. In reality its not bad at all, it's actually a good thing. As robots advance
            technogically, it makes sense that we understand less about the pycology of a robot. They are increadibly
            complex
            peices of machinery, and if we understood everyting about them they would do much less. The things we do
            know
            about robots however, is they will never break the laws of robotics. No matter what happens, they will
            follow
            those rules.

          <h1>The First Machine</h1>
          <h3>Written by: Susan Calvin| 2032</h3>

          <p>When I look back at robotics, I am always amazed by the advancement we have made. When we first started, we
            had robots like Robbie who couldn't even talk, and now we have machines, robots that blend in completely
            with humans. Most people never know that have seen machines, but studies show at least 80% of people have.
