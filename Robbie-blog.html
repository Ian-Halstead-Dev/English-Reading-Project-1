    <h3>Mrs. Weston:</h3>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>When we first got Robbie, Mr. Weston promised me Gloria wouldn't get any connection to him. Here I am, 2 years
      later, having seen my daughter 2 times all day, ready to get rid of Robbie. He has been raising my daughter! I've
      talked to George plenty of times about this, but he doesn't understand. He tells me all my fears are irrational.
      Whenever I talk to him, George dismisses my worries and tells me Robbie is helping Gloria. I say, "Robbie is a
      robot. Metal connected to electricity and he has no soul. He can't be raising our daughter. What if Gloria gets
      hurt?"
      <br>
      <br>
      &emsp; "First off, Robbie cannot hurt any person, including Gloria. That is the first and most important rule for
      all robots. Robbie was made for only one purpose, to be a companion for a child like Gloria. Just because he
      doesn't have a soul, he can still be a good friend for Gloria. Gloria loves him, isn't
      that good enough reason to keep him, Gloria being happy?" and we stopped talking after that. George wouldn't talk
      about it anymore, until last night. Finally, George listened to me and we can take the hunk of metal to the
      factory! I cannot describe how happy I am. I no longer need to worry about Robbie or Gloria, and can live the rest
      of my life knowing I didn't let a machine hurt my daughter.
