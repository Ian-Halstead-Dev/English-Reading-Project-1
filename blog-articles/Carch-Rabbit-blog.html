      When many people think about robots, they think they are infinitely powerful and can do any math calculation in
      any time. While this is a good way of think of robots when it comes to simple tasks, when the task becomes more
      complex or the robot has to do more, it can cause the robot to get confused and not know what to do. Donovan and I
      were working with a robot recently where this because very obvious. The robot had one brain, or hub, and the hub
      controlled six other robots, which you can think of as fingers. Whenever we would send the robot to do a task it
      would never be able to complete it. The fingers, would just march in a line, and not get any work done on the
      task. We interviewed the hub, and one of the fingers which both didn't help. One day, we decided to try to find
      the source of the problem, by watching the rbot do its task from a distance, so it didn't know we were watching
      it. All we saw was the robots in the march formation again. During that time, the cave we were in got closed off,
      and we became trapped. There was a small opening where we could try to get the robots attention to come save us,
      but the only way we could was by shooting one of the fingers. Immediately, the robot came and saved us. We also
      found this fixed our issued and the robot worked perfectly. This really threw us for a loop, until we realized
      that the robot had too many things to do. It had too many fingers and it couldn't process it's information quickly
      enough to tell all the fingers what to do. The reason the robots would march in a line when confused, the hub was
      just “twiddling his fingers.”
