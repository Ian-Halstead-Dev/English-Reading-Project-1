      When I look back at robotics, I am always amazed by the advancement we have made. When we first started, we had
      robots like Robbie who couldn't even talk, and now we have machines, robots that blend in completely with humans.
      Most people never know that have seen machines, but studies show at least 80% of people have. There have even been
      politicians accused of being machines. There was an example of this last year in the election for mayor between
      Quinn and Byerley. Quinn approached some of the members of US Robotics to try to prove Byerley was a machine.
      Because we were the only company that created positronic robots, we agreed to cover ourselves if Byerley was a
      machine. We told him the by following the laws of robotics, we could only prove if Byerley was not a machine, but
      not prove if he was a machine. When we approached him to see if he was a robot, he ate an apple in an attempt to
      prove that he was not a robot. That didn't prove anything however, he could have been a very complicated robot.
      The next day we met with Quinn a and told him what we saw. Lanning claims that we may already be able to prove he
      was not a robot because he was a defense attorney and that he can't a human being whether the person was guilty or
      innocent. I explained that if someone was guilty for something, the robot would be cause harm in that case,
      because more people are being hurt if the robot doesn't say anything. After a few days, Byerley had a final speech
      when a man approached him asking to prove he was not a robot by hitting him. The crowd agreed with the man, and
      Byerley hit him which convinced the crowd he was not a robot. Despite this, I still believe Byerley was a robot.
      If the man he hit was also a robot, it wouldn't be breaking the first law, and I believe a robot would be able to
      do the job of a politician than a human. I'll leave that for you to decide for yourself though, as there is no
      proof he was or was not a robot.
