      I know that title sounds bad. In reality its not bad at all, it's actually a good thing. As robots advance
      technogically, it makes sense that we understand less about the pycology of a robot. They are increadibly complex
      peices of machinery, and if we understood everyting about them they would do much less. The things we do know
      about robots however, is they will never break the laws of robotics. No matter what happens, they will follow
      those rules.
      <br><br>
      I can think of a wonderful example of this that happened a few weeks ago. U.S. Robotics was in a competition with
      our main competitor, Consolidated Robots. We were seeing who could use robots to build an interstellar engine
      which would travel faster than light. Consolidated Robots ran into a problem that caused their robot to break.
      They gave us the calculations, and we were tasked with giving the calculations to out robot, "the brain". We
      spent a lot of time discussing weather we should try the problem, worried the brain might be damaged or destroyed.
      After I pointed out the problem was likely due to a problem in the laws of robotics, and Calvin added that when
      robots come across a problem they can solve they shut down, similar to humans. After more deliberation, we decided
      to accept the challenge. We talked to the brain about the problem, and how the solution might involve "damage to
      human beings" but no to worry about it, even death. After hours of feeding him calculations, he assured us that he
      could build a ship in two months. We invited Donovan and Powell to test the ship. Without us realizing, without us
      realizing the ship took of. The brian tells us Donovan and Powell will both be safe. At this point, we were
      understandably out of hope. We didn't know what the brain was doing or what was going to happen.

      <br><br>
      &emsp; Eventually, Bogert figured out what was happening. When the ship goes faster than light, no living things
      can be there. The ship tempararily "kills" the passengers and brings them back to life after the jump. That is why
      Consolidated Robotics couldn't figure out the problem. Their robot stopped working after seeing any death.
      <br><br>
      &emsp; This story goes to show that although unpredictable, robots will not harm humans. They will follow any
      command given by a human, without causing harm, in any way necessary.
