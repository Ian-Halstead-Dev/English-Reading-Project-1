    <p>When I think of pain I immediately think of physical hurting, and I imagine many others would as well. That is
      what most people think robots are forbidden to do by the first law, hurting humans physically. We have learned
      today that that is not entirely true. Robots still will never be able to hurt humans physically, but we were
      forgetting people can be hurt mentally or emotionally, and robots will never hurt a human mentally. Herbie was
      created with the ability to read minds, but nobody knows why he has this ability. Alfred Lanning, Peter Bogert,
      Milton Ashe, and I (all officers for US Robotics) all decided to figure out what the problem with Herbie was and
      to not tell anyone else about the robots ability. I was directed to study the robot and try to figure out what may
      have given him the power, while Ashe goes to the assembly line to determine the problem there. While talking to
      the robot, I realized he must know about the love I feel towards Ashe. Of course, he does, but assures me that he
      never told Ashe anything. While I was talking to the robot, I started to get very upset. Ashe is younger, and is
      more attractive, and she doesn't think Ashe has feelings for her.. Herbie told me that wasn't true and that Ashe
      does have feelings for me, and I was shocked. I accuse him of lying, and think he is thinking of the wrong girl,
      but Herbie assured me he was talking about me. A day later however, I met with Ashe where he told me he was
      getting married to a different girl. Herbie had lied to me! I tried to keep my feelings hidden while I went
      outside to talk with Herbie. As I was talking to him, Bogert and Lanning both burst into the room claiming Herbie
      lied to them as well. Herbie just stood there, unable to explain what he had told anyone and suddenly something
      clicked in my head. Of course Herbie lied, he can't cause any pain to humans, including mental. Herbie continued
      to stand there, until he suddenly collapsed on the ground.

      &emsp; I've written this to show how far robots will go to obey the first law. No robot will ever hurt you, or and
      other human. They are forbidden to, and will take juristic measures to make sure humans are never hurt.
